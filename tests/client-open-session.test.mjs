/**
 * The session-open dispatch has exactly one owner and one precedence.
 *
 * Why this test exists
 * --------------------
 * Host 0.1.7 dropped `open` from the client `sessions` contract ("navigation
 * belongs to view owners") and moved it to `uiWorkspace.openSession`. The
 * jump kept calling `sessions.open` behind a `typeof === 'function'` guard,
 * which turned the missing method into a silent no-op: on every 0.1.7/0.2.0
 * host, clicking a search hit closed the panel and nothing happened, with no
 * console signal. The React render path is not exercised by this suite (see
 * the note in `client-panel-key.test.mjs`), so the dispatch itself is a pure
 * function (`openSessionThrough`) and this suite pins its whole face.
 *
 * What it proves: `uiWorkspace.openSession` wins when offered; `sessions.open`
 * is the legacy fallback; neither (or method-less faces) → silent no-op.
 * What it does NOT prove: that the panel wires `open` to result clicks — that
 * stays a GUI check.
 *
 * Usage: node --import tsx tests/client-open-session.test.mjs
