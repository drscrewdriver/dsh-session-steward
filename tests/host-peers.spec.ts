/**
 * The peer probe never mistakes "I could not tell" for "it is not installed".
 *
 * Why this test exists
 * --------------------
 * The settings card tells the user where archived sessions are managed. The
 * wording differs depending on whether `dsh-session-steward` is installed, and
 * that answer comes from a resolution probe.
 *
 * The dangerous failure is not a crash — it is a probe that reports `missing`
 * when it merely failed to run: the card would then tell a user to install a
 * plugin they already have installed, which is worse than saying nothing. So
 * the probe has three states, and only a genuine module-not-found may produce
 * `missing`.
 *
 * What it proves: a definitely-absent package reports `missing`; a resolvable
 * specifier reports `installed`; a malformed specifier is not silently
 * classified as absent.
 * What it does NOT prove: that the running profile resolves the steward
 * package — that depends on the profile, not on this code.
 *
 * Usage: pnpm vitest run tests/host-peers.spec.ts
